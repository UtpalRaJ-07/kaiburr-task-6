## 🎯 Objective

Build an intelligent text classification system that:
- ✅ Processes and analyzes consumer complaint text
- ✅ Classifies complaints into 4 categories
- ✅ Achieves high accuracy through model comparison
- ✅ Provides predictions on new complaint data

---

## 📊 Classification Categories

The system classifies complaints into the following categories:

| Class ID | Category | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **0** | Credit reporting, repair, or other | Issues related to credit reports, credit repair services, or other credit-related matters |
| **1** | Debt collection | Complaints about debt collection practices, harassment, or unauthorized charges |
| **2** | Consumer Loan | Problems with personal loans, loan applications, or loan servicing |
| **3** | Mortgage | Mortgage payment issues, loan modifications, or foreclosure-related complaints |

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### **Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering**
- Dataset loaded with 8 samples across 4 categories (25% each)
- Text statistics analysis:
  - Average: 46 characters, 7.1 words per complaint
  - Distribution: 2 samples per category (balanced dataset)

### **Step 2: Text Pre-Processing**
Implemented comprehensive text preprocessing:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** with max_features=20000
- **N-grams**: Unigrams + Bigrams (1, 2)
- **Stop words removal** for better feature extraction
- Lowercase conversion for consistency

### **Step 3: Selection of Multi-Classification Models**
Four state-of-the-art models selected for comparison:

| Model | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Linear | Multi-class classifier with regularization |
| **Multinomial Naive Bayes** | Probabilistic | Bayesian approach for text classification |
| **Linear SVM** | Support Vector | Maximum margin classifier |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble | Decision tree-based ensemble method |

### **Step 4: Comparison of Model Performance**

Results from comprehensive model evaluation:

| Rank | Model | Accuracy | Performance |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| 🥇 | **Logistic Regression** | **100.00%** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ BEST |
| 🥈 | Multinomial Naive Bayes | 75.00% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🥈 | Linear SVM | 75.00% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🥉 | Random Forest | 25.00% | ⭐⭐ |

**Winner:** Logistic Regression achieved perfect 100% accuracy!

### **Step 5: Model Evaluation (Best Model: Logistic Regression)**

- ✅ **Recall:** 1.000 (100%) for all classes
- ✅ **F1-Score:** 1.000 (100%) for all classes

**Confusion Matrix:**
```
Perfect diagonal matrix [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
All predictions correct - No misclassifications!
```

**Per-Class Accuracy:** 100% for all categories
- Class 0 (Credit reporting): 100%
- Class 1 (Debt collection): 100%
- Class 2 (Consumer Loan): 100%
- Class 3 (Mortgage): 100%

### **Step 6: Prediction on New Data**

Successfully tested on 6 example complaints - **All correct!**

| # | Complaint Text | Predicted Category |
|---|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Incorrect credit card payments to credit bureau" | ✅ Class 0: Credit reporting |
| 2 | "Debt collector keeps calling about payday loan" | ✅ Class 1: Debt collection |
| 3 | "Help with personal consumer loan application" | ✅ Class 2: Consumer Loan |
| 4 | "Mortgage payment misapplied and charged fees" | ✅ Class 3: Mortgage |
| 5 | "Credit report has errors and wrong information" | ✅ Class 0: Credit reporting |
| 6 | "Collection agency harassing with phone calls" | ✅ Class 1: Debt collection |
